# Links about GitBook

[General documentation](https://docs.gitbook.com/). Helpful place to start.

[General overview of the actual editing](https://docs.gitbook.com/editing-content/editing-pages). Very helpful to have on hand while experimenting.

[Markdown overview and tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/). Handy, though does not seem to be a must \(as opposed to if we're doing this in the GitHub repo\).
