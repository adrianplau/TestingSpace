# After 9 June session

* The integration between GitHub and GitBook works \(after some tinkering - see the confused ['How does it work?'](../the-github-repository/how-does-it-work.md) entry in the above group.
* Exporting material from GitHub should be straightforward, especially if we keep local copies of the GitHub repo \(I use the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) for this\).
* While it seems perfectly possible to edit both in GitHub and GitBook, it will be far easier to do so in GitBook, which has more of a familiar text editor feel.
