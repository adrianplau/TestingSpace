# How does it work?

This GitBook synchs, or 'integrates', with a GitHub repository - found [here](https://github.com/adrianplau/TestingSpace). Any changes made here make their way into the GitHub repository. Every page is stored there as a .md \(Markdown\) file.

Strangely, it does seem that the integration into GitHub is not always automatic and that somebody has to go to the GitHub repo's [branches](https://github.com/adrianplau/TestingSpace/branches) and manually pull edits from GitBook. This seems odd to me, so I will look a bit further into it.

I have now attempted renaming the default branch in the GitHub repository, does that change anything?

It did indeed work, and the last integration from GitBook now happened without any issue. I'm now typing this line into the GitHub repository, let us see if it works the other way too?

TH: No write access so editing via proposed changes in GitHub repository. This should create a new branch hardytoni/TestingSpace so I can then send a pull request. Let's see if this works as expected and whether it ends up in GitBook.
